<h1>The smallest of galaxies contain a “mere” few hundred million stars while the
    largest galaxies contain up to one hundred trillion stars!</h1>
<h2>Scientists have been able to segment galaxies into 4 main types</h2>
<hr />
<h3>spiral</h3>
<p>The first type of galaxies⁠—spiral galaxies⁠—can be recognized by their wide, flat disks of rotating gas and dust.
</p>

<h3>elliptical</h3>
<p>Elliptical galaxies are given their name because of their oblong shape
    and lack of overall structure. Some are nearly spherical, while others are shaped more like a cigar.
    They can range in size from just a few light years across to being larger than our Milky Way. </p>

<h3>peculiar</h3>
<p>Speaking of galactic collisions, peculiar galaxies are almost always the result of one!
    Galactic collisions aren’t as action packed as you might imagine. </p>

<h3>irregular</h3>
<p>Irregular galaxies are galaxies that don’t fall under any of the three galaxy types mentioned above. These galaxies
    tend to be small, dwarf galaxies that lack any distinguishable shape. Many of these galaxies are companions or
    satellites to larger galaxies. </p>
